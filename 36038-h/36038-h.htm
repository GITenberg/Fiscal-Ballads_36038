<tr><td>
I'm only a common workin'-man,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With a eye to my vittles an' beer,</span><br />
But afore I puts my money on Joe,<br />
There's a thing or two as I'd like to know,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which 'e 'asn't a-made quite clear.</span><br />
<br />
I admit as it sounds attractive-like<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For to shut them furriners out,</span><br />
But every Board School nipper knows<br />
As there's things wot only a furriner grows<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As we couldn't well do without.</span><br />
<br />
There's sugar, an' rice, an' cocoa-nibs,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There's cawfy an' tea as well,</span><br />
As we never could raise, suppose we tried,<br />
And we <i>'as</i> to buy 'em somewheres outside,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the furriners 'as to sell.</span><br />
<br/>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
But they don't give nothin' for nothink&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which you can't dispute the fac'&mdash;</span><br />
An' we're sending 'em hevery bit as much<br />
Of our cotton-goods, an' our coal, an' such,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As 'll pay the beggars back.</span><br />
<br />
An' the less we buys o' them furrin goods,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The less of our own's returned;</span><br />
Which it's plain to see as the more they take,<br />
The more our firms 'as a chance to make,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">An' the 'igher the wages earned.</span><br />
<br />
For it's British Labour as pays the price<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O' them goods as crosses the sea,</span><br />
An' suppose as the furrin imports fail,<br />
It's the case of a empty dinner-pail<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For the workin'-man like me.</span><br />
<br />
Let the furriner send 'is foodstuffs in&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lor' bless you, I ain't afraid!</span><br />
For the more we markets with other lands,<br />
The more employment for British 'ands,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">An' the better for British trade!</span><br />
<br/>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
I 'asn't no love for the German man,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor yet for the 'eathen Turk,</span><br />
But I ain't a fool as 'll shut the door<br />
In the face of even a blooming Boer,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If the beggar can give me work.</span><br />
<br />
For it's work I wants, an' it's wages too,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">An' I'm lookin' afore I leap;</span><br />
I won't go chucking a job away,<br />
On the chance of a possible rise o' pay,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While food's to be 'ad so cheap.</span><br />
<br />
I'm only a workin' artisan,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But the truth I'd like to know;</span><br />
I ain't for takin' no risks, myself,<br />
Of a empty grate an' a empty shelf&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No, thanks, sir, not for Joe!</span><br />
<br />
'E says as 'e'll 'sweep the Country'!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And 'e'll do it too, maybe;</span><br />
If the workin'-men don't 'ave a care,<br />
They'll find as there ain't no Country there,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When 'e's swep' it&mdash;into the sea!</span></td></tr></table>

<tr><td>I've got the dumpophobia bad,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As is easy for to see;</span><br />
(When a little lad I was bit by a mad<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Manufacturin' man, maybe!)</span><br />
An' I simply goes clean off my chump<br />
If anyone 'appens to mention 'dump.'<br />
<br />
For it's 'Out wi' they furriner folks!' sez I;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Will we take it 'lying down,'</span><br />
When they dumps cheap goods (as we wants to buy)<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Into every British town?</span><br />
(Tho' per'aps it's a thing as they wouldn't do<br />
If we 'adn't a-given 'em orders to!)<br />
<br/>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
But there's good times coming, an' thanks to Joe,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When the Hempire 'll stand on 'er own;</span><br />
We'll be quit o' the food them furriners grow,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">An' rely on ourselves alone.</span><br />
For us, an' the Colonies too, I lay,<br />
Can grow it as good an' better'n they!<br />
<br />
We're a British race, an' we'll soon depend<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On the produc's o' British soil;</span><br />
No more of our 'ard-earned wage we'll spend<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Upon cheap American oil;</span><br />
Them dazzlin' lamps is a big mistake,<br />
While there's tallow candles o' British make!<br />
<br />
We've the finest coal in the 'ole wide earth,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which we used for to sell abroad;</span><br />
But now as we knows 'ow much it's worth,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We'll save it, an' 'old it, an' 'oard.</span><br />
(Tho' the pitmen 'll 'ave a word to say<br />
When the mines shuts down an' they're turned away!)<br />
<br/>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
No more o' the Roosian's corn we'll touch,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor the South American wheat;</span><br />
An' we'll gladly pay, if it's twice as much,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To 'ave <i>British</i> loaves to eat!</span><br />
(For the English working-man, these days,<br />
'E must learn for to live on Colonial maize.)<br />
<br />
If there's less to eat it'll taste more sweet,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When the Britishers all combine;</span><br />
We'll 'ave tinned an' frozen Noo Zealand meat,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Washed down with Australian wine!</span><br />
(Which it ain't so terrible bad to drink,<br />
If you fancies honions mixed with ink.)<br />
<br />
No more o' your Roosian sable cloaks<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For the gentry, nor Paris 'ats;</span><br />
They're buying their bunnets at Sevenoaks,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">An' the trimmin's is 'Ounsditch cats;</span><br />
An' that furrin' jewelry's just a sham,<br />
They can sell you as good in Birming'<i>am</i>.<br />

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
Them Italian organs 'll 'ave to go,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">An' the ice-cream barrers as well,</span><br />
When we're buying a 'alfpenny glass o' snow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From some smart Canadian swell.</span><br />
An' no more o' your music from Germanee,<br />
When our motto is 'Bands acrost the sea!'<br />
<br />
When the furriner's foodstuffs out we shuts,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We'll still 'ave the run of our teeth</span><br />
On the cocoa we makes off o' cocoanuts<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As they grows upon 'Ampstead 'Eath!</span><br />
An' o' British pluck we can surely brag,<br />
When we're smoking the 'omegrown Irish shag!<br />
<br />
We're a-buyin' our food too cheap, sez Joe<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(If you listens to 'is advice);</span><br />
The cost o' the loaf's too small, an' so<br />

I've 'ad a quarrel with 'Enery Slade,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Oo keeps our only village inn;</span><br />
'E said as 'is shoes was badly made,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">An' I said as 'is 'alf-an'-'alf was thin.</span><br />
'No more o' <i>your</i> boots I'll buy,' sez 'e,<br />
'An' no more o' <i>your</i> beer,' sez I, 'for me!'<br />
<br />
Nex' time as 'is shoes was out o' repair,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'E took 'em to Lunnon, 'Enery did;</span><br />
An' wot wi' the bill an' the railway fare,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Why, it cost 'im werry near 'alf a quid.</span><br />
If 'e'd stayed at 'ome an' give <i>me</i> the job,<br />
'E wouldn't 'a paid but a couple o' bob!<br />
<br/>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
Now, tinkering boots is a thirsty trade,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which them as 'as tried it won't deny,</span><br />
But I wouldn't get beer orf o' 'Enery Slade,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">An' there wasn't no other's as I could buy;</span><br />
An' so, for a month very near, I think,<br />
I was starving a'most for the lack of a drink.<br />
<br />
But at last to a comperimize we come,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">An' 'e said as my boots was right enough,</span><br />
An' I told 'im&mdash;arter I'd tasted some&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As 'is beer wasn't really 'alf bad stuff;</span><br />
So we both shakes 'ands on the village green,<br />
An' we seed what a couple o' fools we'd been.<br />
<br />
But there wasn't no good come out o' the fight,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">An' we're both worse off than we was before;</span><br />
Tho' I sits in 'is private bar of a night,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">An' 'e gives me 'is shoes to mend once more;</span><br />
For Slade's lost 'is temper, an' eight bob clear,<br />
An' I'll <i>never</i> catch up wi' that three weeks' beer!<br />
<br/>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Now if England quarrels with Roosia, say,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or them aggrannoying United States,</span><br />
She can tax their imports, an' make 'em pay<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">More 'eavier dooties an' 'igher rates;</span><br />
But suppose as we taxes the goods they sell,<br />
It's likely as they'll tax ours as well.<br />
<br />
An' o' manufactured goods, an' such,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We're sendin' three times as much as they;</span><br />
So I can't see as 'ow we'll be gaining much,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With a three times 'eavier tax to pay.</span><br />
(It's a game as two can play, you see,<br />
An' they'll be a-suffering less than we!)<br />
<br />
For the balance o' goods as they sells to us<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is the corn, an' the grain, an' the foods we eat;</span><br />
An' it's likely the working class 'll cuss<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If we levies a tax on the furrin wheat,</span><br />
Which 'll merely fall on the poor man's 'ead,<br />
By a-raising the price of 'is loaf o' bread.<br />
<br/>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
This Retaliation's a tom-fool game;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If we taxes the furriner's barley 'ere,</span><br />
We shall only be 'aving ourselves to blame<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When we 'as to pay more for our dinner-beer!</span><br />

'Ow fine it'd be if we'd all agree<br />
On a kind of a mutual trade, sez 'e,<br />

We'd 'elp one another (which sounded nice),<br />

<br />
I'd tinker the boots o' the family cheap,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">An' get 'ome on my uncle's beer,</span><br />

An' for luxuries, such as the missus eats,<br />
I could get 'em 'alf-price orf o' Katie's sweets.<br />
<br />
But it didn't work. For my Uncle Fred<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'E treated me crool unfair;</span><br />
I sold 'im some shoes, starvation price,<br />
But I 'adn't a-tasted 'is beer but twice<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When 'e said as I'd drunk my share!</span><br />
Then I mended a couple o' pairs o' Kate's&mdash;<br />

<br />
But there's some undisputed fac's&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">An' even figures won't gainsay it:</span><br />
One is, if you puts on a tax,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Someone or other <i>'as</i> to pay it.</span><br />

The thing I'm anxious for to learn<br />
Is wot does <i>'e</i> get in return?<br />
<br />
When prices they goes up a bit,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The rich exchequer of the nation</span><br />

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
